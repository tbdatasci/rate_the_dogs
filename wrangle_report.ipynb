    "This was significantly more involved than the other two.  I had to acquire a Twitter API license with an accompanying reason for my access request. After that, I queried Twitter's API using a package called \"tweepy\", which is designed to allow a Python user to interact with Twitter's API.  This allowed me to get JSON data for each Tweet into Python, which I then wrote to a .txt file.  After that, I read the JSON data into a pandas dataframe, where I could better extract the data I wanted (number of favorites and number of retweets per tweet)."
